## Features

### **LSTM Deep Learning Forecasting**
- Predicts **1-day**, **15-day**, and **30-day** stock prices  
- Uses a tuned **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture  
- Trained on multi-year historical data  
- Hyperparameter tuning with **Keras Tuner**

### **News Sentiment Analysis**
- Fetches real-time news via **NewsAPI**  
- Uses **TextBlob** to calculate sentiment polarity  
- Sentiment becomes an input signal for the ML model  

### **Technical Indicators Included**
Automatically calculates:
- 50-day & 200-day Moving Average  
- RSI  
- MACD  
- EMA  
- OHLCV features

### **Built-in Chatbot (GPT-2)**
- Answers finance-related questions  
- Uses HuggingFace Transformers  
- Context-aware, concise responses  

### **Flask Web Application**
- Interactive stock prediction UI  
- CSV export for 30-day forecasts  
- News page with sorting & deduplication  
- Trending stocks widget  

### **Automated Testing Suite**
Includes tests for:
